## Build Status 

[![Build](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/VS_Win_Meadow_Extension/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/VS_Win_Meadow_Extension/actions)

## Getting Started

To develop for this extension, you will need some prerequisites.

The [Meadow.CLI](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.CLI) repo must be cloned adjacent to this checkout using the `develop` branch. This repo is used to resolve shared code and project references.

You will also need the **Visual Studio extension development** and **.NET desktop environment** workloads. Visual Studio should prompt to install these the first time you open one of the extension solutions.
